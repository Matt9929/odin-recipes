# odin-recipes
In this project we're going to build a simple HTML website consisting in a Index page with links to other pages which will contain a recipe each.
The goal is to showcase what I've learn with TOP so far, tasks such as using Git, VSCode and basic HTML tags.
While I have some leftover HTML skills from school, GIT is uncharted territory for me so I'm looking forward to learn more about it.
